# Atritree

This repo contains the Atritec Potree Demo. As some things we want to do require adding functionality to Potree, we keep a repo of these changes.

# To run:

```npm install && npm build```

Then build and run the docker image.

# About

* Potree is a free open-source WebGL based point cloud renderer for large point clouds. It is based on the [TU Wien Scanopy project](https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/projects/Scanopy/) and research projects [Harvest4D](https://harvest4d.org/), [GCD Doctoral College](https://gcd.tuwien.ac.at/) and [Superhumans](https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/projects/Superhumans/).

# Getting Started

### Install on your PC

Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)

Install dependencies, as specified in package.json, and create a build in ./build/potree.

```bash
npm install
```

### Run on your PC

Use the `npm start` command to 

* create ./build/potree 
* watch for changes to the source code and automatically create a new build on change
* start a web server at localhost:1234. 

Go to http://localhost:1234/examples/ to test the examples.

### Deploy to a server

* Simply upload the Potree folderm with all your point clouds, the build directory, and your html files to a web server.
* It is not required to install node.js on your webserver. All you need is to host your files online. 

### Convert Point Clouds to Potree Format

Download [PotreeConverter](https://github.com/potree/PotreeConverter) and run it like this:

    ./PotreeConverter.exe C:/pointclouds/data.las -o C:/pointclouds/data_converted

Copy the converted directory into &lt;potreeDirectory&gt;/pointclouds/data_converted. Then, duplicate and rename one of the examples and modify the path in the html file to your own point cloud.
